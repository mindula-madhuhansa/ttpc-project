# Train Ticket Price Calculator (TTPC)

This project was created for the University of Kelaniya 1st year 2nd semester group project, as part of the Electronics and Computer Science course. The goal of the project is to create a train ticket price calculator that can issue tickets from a station.

The project was built using the Java programming language with Java Swing used to create the GUI. It is designed to calculate the ticket price based on the distance between the starting(For now only for from Colombo station) and ending stations, as well as the type of ticket (e.g. first class, second class and third class) and the amount of tickets.

# Usage
To use the train ticket price calculator, simply run the Java program and follow the on-screen prompts. The program will ask for the ending stations, the train class, and number of the passengers. Once all the information has been entered, the program will calculate the ticket price and display it on the screen.
